    "### 3.\tAuditors at a small community bank randomly sample 100 withdrawal transactions made during the week at an ATM machine located near the bankâ€™s main branch. Over the past 2 years, the average withdrawal amount has been 50 dollars with a standard deviation of 40 dollars. Since audit investigations are typically expensive, the auditors decide to not initiate further investigations if the mean transaction amount of the sample is between 45 dollars and 55 dollars. What is the probability that in any given week, there will be an investigation?"
